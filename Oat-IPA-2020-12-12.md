Its not often i post my recipies as i find that not many are really worth it, but since i have made quite a vast amount of NEIPA, i have nailed down what i find an amazing combination using a simple ingredient list without too complex of a process.

The average time from grain to glass is 9 days. Explained below.

## GRAIN BILL:
**Base:**

| | |
|---|---|
| 12# pale malt | i like Skagit Valley Talisman pale, it has some MO/golden promise flavor but cheaper|
| .25# honey malt | just to provide a slight sweetness to compliment the hops and give a jucier flavor |
| .25# carapils | helps with head retention |
| 1# flaked oats | use rice hulls if using oats to help with draining mash tun more evenly |

OR

|||
|---|---|
| 1# | white wheat |

Thats it, 13.5# grain bill, my notes of others tasting this side by side with the oats vs wheat tells me tht not to many can tell a difference between the 2, but i perfer the mouthfeel of the oats, it feels creamier to me. THESE ADDITIONS ARE NOT TO ADD HAZE, THEY ARE THERE FOR FEEL. The haze comes from the dry hopping times as a by product.

### MASH:
i mash at 149, simple single infusion, nothing fancy or complicated. I have tried a drier 146, and a sweeter 154 and i feel as tho 149 is just a perfect balance to get the hops and malt to play off eachother without overdoing one or the other.

### HOPS:
1oz magnum FWH (i add these to my boil kettle and then start my lauter on top of them to steep until im at full boil volume which for me is 8gal)

1oz amarillo at flameout and then start cooling to 160

Once your down to 160 stop the chiller and add

3oz amarillo

Stir every 2 min or whirlpool, and let steep for 20 min

Dry hops are: (added between 24-36 hours after pitch)

6 oz amarillo

~ I have used many different combos as a dry hop, but i really like how the fruitiness of azacca plays with the berry flavor of mosaic and citrus flavor of the citra. I have used galaxy, idaho 7, vic secret, amarillo, cascade, medusa, el dorado and a few others, but i really like the galaxy in the whirlpool and azacca as a dry hop....it just works great! I have also tried the citra/mosaic/azacca in a lower quantity, but it just wasnt enough to me. ~

## YEAST AND FERMENTATION:

I like wy1318, i have used the yeast bays Vermont ale, wy1968, so4, wlp002, and i really like 1318 the best.

I ferment at 68F, and dry hop the day after i brew. I let it go for 7 days, and check but am always down to 1.010 at day 7, then i turn temp down to 45. The next day on day 8, i keg and pressureize to 35psi and purge 3 times, then pressurize again to 35 and shake/roll the keg for a few min, i then purge again and pressurize to 12psi to sit for 24 hours.

Day 9 i am drinking


**Water:**

I use 100% RO water and build to a very specific profile which is:

* 95ppm calcium
* 12ppm magnesium
* 30ppm sodium
* 80ppm sulfate
* 175ppm chloride

My process to get to this is adding the following straight into the mash as i am dding in the grain:

* 4.24g calcium chloride
* 1.41g epsom salt
* 1.26g gypsum
* 1.11 canning salt (pure NaCl)

As the mash is going, i add the following to the sparge water and stir to disolve before i start the sparging:

* 6.21g calcium chloride
* 2.07g epsome salt
* 1.85g gypsum
* 1.63g canning salt (pure NaCl)

I have also done a lower ration of sulfate to chloride with a 90 sulfate to 110 chloride, which isnt bad, but tasted alot more bitter and i like the hop flavor without the back end bitterness bite.

### NOTES:

I have done 60 min boils, 75 min boils and 90 min boils. I particularly perfer the 75 min boil, but this can be done with a 60 min boil. The ibu numbers will be slightly different but it would not be noticeable, and you would need to adjust the salts as you would be using less water throughout the whole process and i can gi e you the adjusted amounts if you want it.
