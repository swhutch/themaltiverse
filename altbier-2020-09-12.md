Altbier

German Altbier is not a terribly common style these days. There are very few commercial examples, but I’ve got an award winning Altbier recipe I’d like to share with you.

The most common commercial example is probably Alaskan’s Alt Style Amber (which I really enjoy).

Mine is not a clone recipe. Rather it’s one of my own devising. I created it a few years ago based on what research I had done on the style, as well as some other recipes I found online.

The following recipe is what I came up with, and in my humble opinion, it’s a damn fine Altbier.

### ABOUT THIS STYLE
According to the BJCP 2015 Style Guidelines, a typical Altbier can be simply described as follows:

A well-balanced, well-attenuated, bitter yet malty, clean, and smooth, amber- to copper-colored German beer. The bitterness is balanced by the malt richness, but the malt intensity and character can range from moderate to high (the bitterness increases with the malt richness).

You can read the full style description and stats here.

One thing that really distinguishes this style is that it sort of straddles the line between a lager and an ale fermentation profile.

There are a few yeast strains especially well suited for this style.  Fermentis K-97 Dry German Ale Yeast is a good choice due to it’s clean ester profile, and high flocculation.

### MY INTERPRETATION
Award Winning Altbier Recipe

THIS ALTBIER LOOKS PRETTY TASTY, RIGHT?

As I mentioned, my recipe is kind of a combination of some examples I found elsewhere, along with my own research into the style. Since there were so few commercial examples readily available,  I really had to go with my gut and just try to brew a good beer.

The recipe itself is really quite simple. This is almost always the best approach.

As long as you don’t have anything that really clashes, a simple recipe will almost always come out “pretty good” at least. I believe that a good Altbier recipe is pretty simple and easy as well.

This was actually one of the first recipes I came up with on my own. As was my custom at the time, I named it after a popular video game from my youth. Altered Beast.

I named it that for three reasons:

* I really liked that game
* It sounded like a cool name for a beer recipe
* It’s an Altbier, so ALTered Beast just seemed to fit

### MY AWARD WINNING ALTBIER RECIPE
This all grain Altbier recipe is pretty simple. I think you’ll find that to be a common theme in my recipes.

However, one thing that is not quite so simple is that this style, due to it’s supposed “hybrid” nature, does require a fairly specific yeast and fermentation profile.

Of course, as with any recipe, you are free to adapt it to fit your own needs and capabilities. Don’t stress too hard if you have to sub out the yeast. Just try to stay on the cool end of your chosen yeast’s range if possible.

### STATISTICS
According to my currently preferred beer recipe creation tool, BeerSmith Mobile, the expected statistics for my Altbier recipe, using my brewing setup, are as follows:

* OG – 1.049
* FG – 1.009
* IBU – 38.5
* SRM – 15.2
* ABV – 5.28

Final results may vary depending on the efficiency of your own brewing setup.

### GRAIN BILL
* 55.8% German Pils Malt
* 18.6% Munich Malt
* 18.6% Vienna Malt
* 4.7% Caramunich Malt
* 2.3% Chocolate Malt

So for a typical 6 gallon batch (allowing for some loss and an eventual 5 gallons of packaged beer), that might look something like this:

* 6lb German Pils Malt
* 2lb Munich Malt
* 2lb Vienna Malt
* 8oz Caramunich Malt
* 4oz Chocolate Malt

The chocolate malt is just for a bit of color.

### HOP SCHEDULE
I use Northern Brewer hops at FWH (first wort hopping) for my Altbier’s bittering addition.

For flavor and aroma, I use Saaz

For the same 6 gallon batch size, assuming your EKGs are contain a typical 5% AA (Alpha Acid), your additions might look like this:

@FWH (First Wort Hops) – 1 oz Northern Brewer Hops(roughly 36 IBU)

@ Flameout – 1 oz Saaz Hops  (roughly 2.5 IBU)

*Important Note:* Check the Alpha Acid numbers on your package of hops. Depending on the starting AA and the age, you may need to adjust the amount of hops added to hit your bitterness target!

### YEAST
As mentioned before, Fermentis K-97 Dry German Ale Yeast is a good choice for this Altbier recipe.

Other appropriate yeasts are available from most of the good yeast labs. Here are some important things to look for.

**German Ale Yeast**

* High flocculation
* Clean ester profile
* Good performance at lower ale temperatures

In a pinch, you could even use a good ol’ satchet of US-05 American Ale yeast and come out with good results.

I try to keep some of that yeast on-hand for surprise brew days, just because it is so versatile and clean. You might have noticed that I am suggesting a couple of different dry yeasts here. There are of course good liquid yeasts available as well:

**Here are a few good liquid yeast options:**

* White Labs 036 Dusseldorf Alt Yeast
* Wyeast 1007 German Ale Yeast
 

## BREW DAY

### THE WATER
I generally use Reverse Osmosis water from the store or my home RO filtration system to start with. This leaves a blank slate with no chlorine or chloramines, but also strips the water of ‘good tasting’ ions.

I typically add **a teaspoon of Calcium Chloride and Gypsum** as a base for many of my recipes.

### THE MASH
I mash this recipe at a slightly lower temperature for a longer time in order to (in theory) produce a more fermentable wort.

I do this since my preferred yeast (mentioned above) is not super attenuative, and I want my Altbier to have a nice, crisp finish.

For this reason, I go with a **75 minute mash at 148 degrees F**.

### THE BOIL
Nothing special here, especially since there are no mid-boil hop additions.

Just add your FWH addition when you begin sparging into your boil kettle, then hit it with the flameout addition after a traditional 60 minute boil.

### THE CHILL
I covered this in my Belgian Blonde ale recipe, and that’s pretty much my standard chilling procedure. In fact, I should probably turn that into a separate article. I’ll do that soon. EDIT: I did!

**RECOMMENDED:** Wort Chiller Comparison 

### FERMENTATION
**RECOMMENDED:** Best Fermentation Temperature Controller

The  Fermentis K-97 yeast is listed to prefer a temperature range of 59-70 degrees F.

If you can even keep it a little lower through the majority of fermentation, that’s even better. Once the bulk of primary fermentation is complete, I wouldn’t worry about raising the temp up towards the higher end of the range to encourage complete attenuation and hopefully clean up any potential off-flavors.

After fermentation is complete, it’s time to package your award winning altbier. Enjoy, like everything in life, sharing is caring! So please use the buttons at the top or bottom of this post to share the recipe with one of your homebrewing friends!
