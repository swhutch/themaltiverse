# Brewing Tips

## Mash PH

### Before Mash-In

1. Use software to estimate mash pH
2. Use estimated value to determine the amount of lactic acid to use
3. Add about 80% of acid up front __before__ mash in. 

This usually gets mash pH within the acceptable 5.2-5.6 range. 

### After Dough In

1. Take a measurement with pH meter after dough in
2. Make any fine adjustments needed with additional acid based on that measurement.

***

If your pH is above the 5.2 to 5.4 range (when measured at mash temperature), add some 88% lactic acid half a millilitre (mL) at a time using a 1mL (1 cc) syringe, stir well and wait for at least 5-10 minutes, and re-measure until you get close to 5.2 (when measured at mash temperature). It usually only takes one or two millilitres at most for most beers in a batch this size if you were able to hit the proper mineral flavour profile in the previous steps.
