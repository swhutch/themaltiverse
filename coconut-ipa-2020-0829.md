### Notes

- Total of 1lbs of coconut. .5lb in the boil and then .25lbs into each fermenter/keg.
- 1lbs of sugar into the boil; .75lbs sugar dissolved and tossed into each fermenter when fermentation shows signs of slowing.
- Could have used cal ale yeast and would have been great too I'm sure, I just had that on hand.
- Definitely the untoasted coconut is my favorite of the batches I've done. The toasted coconut added too much of a burnt/roasted flavor even if you don't over toast it.
- The 60 minute hop additions did not have to be all that, I just had some hops I wanted to get rid of and they were all clean bittering, high AA.
- I really like the addition of centennial and mosaic in the recipe as well, it adds more depth of flavor!
- Only issue I had was FG stopped at 1.014 instead of what i would have rather had of around 1.010 to dry it out a bit more but not a big deal.
- the strict citra and galaxy melded better with the coconut I thought. I might dry hop just a slight bit more citra and galaxy to up those flavors in my current beer.

If you brew it and you keg the beer, I would do the coconut in the boil, then dry hop it and then see if you need more coconut or not. Just be careful with the dry coconutting, it imparts flavor fast! You definitely get a HUGE amount of aroma and flavor though when you dry hop it, so I would suggest doing it some.
The best rounded flavor I was able to get was after doing what I have listed above. If you do too much of the coconut it comes across too sweet, and if you hop it too much it will overpower the coconut.
