DIRECTIONS
Mash for 40 minutes at 154°F (68°C), then for 10 minutes at 162°F (72°C). Mash out at 171°F (77°C). Boil for 60 minutes following the hops and additions schedule. For the lactose, remove the kettle from the heat, stir in the lactose, return the kettle to the heat, and bring it back to a boil for the remaining 10 minutes.

After the boil, chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 64°F (18°C). Aerate the wort and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 66°F (19°C).

We do two dry-hop additions: one at 30 percent attenuation (about 1.048) and then again at about 1.024. We divide the dry-hop total weight evenly between the two additions.
