### DIRECTIONS
Mill the grains and mix with **3.2 gallons** (12.1 l) of **163°F (73°C) strike water** to reach a **mash temperature of 152°F** (67°C). Hold this temperature for **60 minutes**. Vorlauf until your runnings are clear, then run off into the kettle. **Sparge the grains with 4.1 gallons** (15.4 l) and top up as necessary to **obtain 6 gallons** (23 l) of wort. **Boil for 60 minutes**, following the hops schedule.

After the boil, chill the wort to slightly below fermentation temperature, about 50°F (10°C). Aerate the wort with pure oxygen or filtered air and pitch the yeast. Ferment at 50°F (10°C) for 3 days, then allow temperature to rise to 60°F (16°C) over the next 4 days. Upon completion of fermentation, crash the beer to 35°F (2°C), then bottle or keg and carbonate to approximately 2.25 volumes of CO2.

### Tips for Success
Let this beer sit in the fridge for a solid **4–6 weeks** before opening it! Not only will the lagering time allow the beer to clear to a nice crystalline amber, but it will also round off the bitterness and lingering hints of roast, leaving behind a dry, toasty, floral delight. That chocolate malt is the secret ingredient: it keeps the beer nice and dry for months, and without it, you could easily end up with an overly sweet melanoidin bomb.

### notes

* bring starter down to pitching temp along with wort
* acidify sparge water with lactic acid to just below pH 7 and do not sparge at a temperature higher than 170 °F
* Use fresh, liquid yeast, preferably do a starter and pitch one to two pints of slurry per 10 gallons
* oxygenate w/ a sanitized stainless steel whisk until it has at least a couple inches (several centimeters) of foam on top. 
* sanitize a (new) paint stirrer, attach it to an electric drill and agitate the wort accordingly
